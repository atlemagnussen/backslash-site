# About

## This a web site blog that I created myself

### Here I will write things that I feel is worth writing down.

I am a web/system developer and have been working with it professionally since 2005, this means a great deal of javascript, html and css and many different backends

In addition to web based systems I also have a passion for operating systems and especially *nix  

I also have worked a great deal with .NET framework and MS based coorporate software  

I also meddle around with security knowledge like encryption and how to protect home networks  

Please feel free contact me if anything, I have added some social media links in my menu.
